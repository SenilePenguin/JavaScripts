# PublicScripting
A Collection of scripts and files I wrote/modified for my projects.


Anyone is welcome to use/fork/modify any of the scripts found in these directories. Many of these are cobbled together to serve very niche purposes I had, then somewhat generalized for use in multiple different projects of mine. I am not a professional developer, so bugs are likely. I'd be happy to accept any pull requests to squash said bugs!

All files stored here are hosted via GitHub Pages simply for accessibility purposes. Please note that this means, while you are welcome to link or reference them, that any content within this directory is subject to change at any time as I work on things. Though I will make efforts to preserve compatibility where possible, I cannot make any guarantees. 

If you wish to use these documents, either accept this caveat or create a fork and host your own mirror! Note that your mirror will shows as being X commits behind if make any updates, which would let you compare branches and fix for your environment if needed.
