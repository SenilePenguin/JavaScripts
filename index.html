<p>Welcome to my page! I don't have much knowledge for setting this up to look pretty, so feel free to give me a Pull Request with some help!</p>
<p>I don't have any plans for this page, as my pages site is for hosting JS and CSS mostly right now. If you'd like to see what I have to offer 
    by way of scripts and content, please head on over to <a href="https://github.com/SenilePenguin/PublicScripting">the GitHub repository!</a>
